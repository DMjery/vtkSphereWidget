# VTKSphereWidget

A Qt + VTK-based GUI application that visualizes and dynamically deforms a 3D sphere using random parameters.
This application is based on an example of Qt + VTK published on https://examples.vtk.org/site/Cxx/Qt/MinimalQtVTKApp/.
The official example lacks any formal structure, i.e. it is _Spaghetti Code_ or _monolithic_,
therefore, is not practical.

_VTKSphereWidget_ is designed using a well-established architecture, commonly used for Qt (C++),
namely, Model-View-Controller (MVC). It provides a template for some of the most essential components of 
a Qt+VTK widget including _VTK sources, VTK rendered window, Qt Layout, Qt Widget and window_. The list is
non-exhaustive, yet lays the ground for adding features and sources on demand.

This project includes standard tests based on GoogleTest. The tests are only examples 
and mainly concern constructors and initializations.
